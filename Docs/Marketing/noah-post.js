Hi Noah,

Your content is awesome! After going through all the Tony Robbins videos on YouTube, I'm happy I was able to find another source of business inspiration.

I heard you say somewhere that the AppSumo Shopify App made over $1 million in sales.
I just launched my Shopify App which provides Community Building Features for Shopify Stores.
Last week, I put $220 on Shopify PPC Ads - which generated 50 clicks, and got 4 installs.
But 3/4 of the new users, immediately uninstalled the software.
I've got the Facebook and Adroll Retargeting pixels already installed on the App Listing.

I don't mind improving the product. 

It seems that people need more motivation once they actually install the app (I'm thinking of auto-populating a couple of blog posts within a new installation - you know, kind of like in wordpress when you install a new theme, and they populate the theme with some blog content to help you visualize what it looks like when the content is generated) - after all, I'm selling an add-on CMS for Shopify Stores to enable shoppers to create content.

Fact is, I've already completed my 100-days challenge, and now I've got new challenges which will probably require another 100 days in order to break through them.

I think with the right funnel, and a little bit of faith and perseverane, I might be able to bring the acquisition strategy to under $20 per user. The app's monthly subscription fee is $19 monthly,
