Hi {{first_name}},

I was wondering if you've ever tried to build community via Shopify?
We just came out with a new Shopify App, and are looking for shops that want to trial the software, for free, for somewhere between 6 months to a year.

I was wondering if you have anyone in your network that this type of offer might be relevant for. The only thing we would ask for in return is some feedback on the product.
